    <h1>Notes:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Mobile usage is continually rising, which brings the need for a focus on making applications and webpages 
            mobile first.
        </li>
        <li>
            Working from a small screen first and scaling up to larger screens is much easier for developers, it also 
            allows the developer to focus on all the content being available on the mobile version that needs to be there.
        </li>
        <li>
            Focusing on making content as easy to find as possible is makes the user a lot happier and less likely to leave 
            the website. Having a few extra steps may seem trivial but for the user having the least amount of steps makes 
            it a lot less frustrating to deal with a website or application.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reachability is important, making key elements to a website and application reachable to the user from the bottom 
            of the screen. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Making sure that you aren't overly complicating the amount of data that has to be downloaded can help users on 
            slower internet connections. around 25% of users are on a 3G network with only 1.8% are on a 4G network (as of 2013). 
            Minifying JS and CSS files can help with this as well as limiting photo sizes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Making forms simpler and easier to complete will cause the user less stress and make them less likely to leave the 
            form early. Allowing autocomplete in forms will allow them to complete forms a lot faster. Masking a password has 
            been found to be almost pointless, instead show the password by default and allow the option to hide it.
        </li>
